## 📂 Project Structure

Problems are grouped by difficulty level (easy, medium, hard) and each problem has its own folder with the following structure:

```plaintext
📦 problems/
 ┣ 📂 easy/                # Easy problems
 ┃ ┣ 📂 ProblemName/
 ┃ ┃ ┣ 📄 solution.go       # Implementation of the solution
 ┃ ┃ ┣ 📄 solution_test.go  # Unit tests for the solution
 ┣ 📂 medium/              # Medium problems
 ┃ ┣ 📂 ProblemName/
 ┃ ┃ ┣ 📄 solution.go
 ┃ ┃ ┣ 📄 solution_test.go
 ┣ 📂 hard/                # Hard problems
 ┃ ┣ 📂 ProblemName/
 ┃ ┃ ┣ 📄 solution.go
 ┃ ┃ ┣ 📄 solution_test.go
```
